    <h1>Disjoint-Set (Union-Find)</h1>
    <p>
      The Disjoint-Set data structure, also known as Union-Find, is designed to
      efficiently keep track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It
      supports two main operations: union and find
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Union:</b> Merges two subsets into a single set.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Find:</b> Determines the subset to which a particular element belongs
        and can be used to check if two elements are in the same subset
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This data structure is particularly useful for solving dynamic
      connectivity, such as determening whether there is a path between two
      elements in a graph.
    </p>

    <p><b>How it works:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Each element initially belongs to its own subset, and a representative
        (root) is assigned to each subset.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>'Union'</b> operation merges two subsets by making the root of
        one subset to the root of the other subset
      </li>
      <li>
        The <b>'Find'</b> operation determines the representative of the subset
        to which an element belongs by following the chain of parent pointers
        until reaching the root.
      </li>
    </ol>
